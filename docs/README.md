# Celestial Docs

These docs are made for GitHub pages using Jekyll and the `just-the-docs` theme.
You need Ruby < v3.3.0 for this to work ([thanks, GitHub!](https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/899#issuecomment-1880156387)).

GitHub recommends `bundler`:

```sh
gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You should now be able to view documentation locally at `http://localhost:4000`.
